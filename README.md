# Smoking Scene Detection (Deep Learning)

This project is about detecting whether an image/scene contains smoking or not using a deep learning model. I built and tested this project as part of my machine learning practice and academic work using Kaggle.

The main goal was to understand how image classification works using CNN-based models and how a model can be trained to recognize smoking-related scenes.
